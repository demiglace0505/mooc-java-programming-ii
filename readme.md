# [University of Helsinki Java MOOC](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)

Welcome! This repository serves as a central hub for all my thoughts, solutions, and processes for the online course Java Programming by University of Helsinki. The course teaches the basics of object-oriented programming with the use of Java. The scope of this online course is identical to the CS1 Introduction to Programming and Advanced Programming courses held at said university.

The course takes an interactive approach wherein I used an actual IDE (Netbeans with TMC plugin) for performing the exercises. The course includes comprehensive materials and interactive exercises. Each completed exercise is tested and scored, and the complete code of my solutions can be found in this repository, within each subdirectory.
